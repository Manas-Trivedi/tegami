## Code of Conduct

This project follows a simple rule: **be respectful**. Harassment, discrimination, or hostile communication of any kind will not be tolerated. Violations may result in being banned from contributing.

---

## Repository Layout

**Do not add data files to the repository root.** The repo is organized into two
tracks, and CI (`scripts/check_structure.py`) will fail your PR if a data file
lands at the root. Put new files where they belong:

| What you're adding | Where it goes |
|--------------------|---------------|
| City contact batch (`city_<city>_NN.csv`) | `industry/city/` |
| Numbered send batch (`batch_NN.csv`) | `industry/batches/` |
| Location-less batch (`unsorted_NN.csv`) | `industry/unsorted/` |
| A source/company sheet (`*.csv`) | `industry/` |
| A batch-appender script (`add_*.py`) or any script | `scripts/` |
| Faculty data (research track) | `research/faculty/<iits\|nits\|iiits>/<state>/<city>/<institute>.csv` |

- Generated outputs (`industry/batches/`, `industry/city/`, `industry/unsorted/`)
  are produced by `scripts/gen_batches.py` / `scripts/gen_city_batches.py`. Run those
  from anywhere; they resolve their own paths.
- Research faculty CSVs must keep the canonical header (see
  [`research/README.md`](research/README.md)); `scripts/validate_data.py` enforces it.

Run the same checks CI runs before you push:

```bash
python scripts/check_structure.py
python scripts/validate_data.py
```

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please [open an issue](https://github.com/eeshsaxena/outreach-emails/issues/new) with:

1. **A clear, descriptive title** - e.g., `[Bug] add_pasted_batch.py does not write output to CSV`
2. **Steps to reproduce** - exact commands, inputs, and environment
3. **Expected behaviour** - what should have happened
4. **Actual behaviour** - what actually happened, including error messages/tracebacks
5. **File & line number** - pinpoint the location of the bug
6. **Suggested fix** (optional) - if you already know the fix

> [!TIP]
> Before filing a new issue, search existing issues to avoid duplicates.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Open an issue with the label `enhancement` and describe:
- What problem the enhancement solves
- Your proposed solution
- Any alternatives you considered

### Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Fork** the repository and create a branch from `master`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/your-fix-description
   ```

2. **Make your changes** - keep each PR focused on a single fix or feature.

3. **Test your changes** locally before pushing.

4. **Ensure no sensitive data** is included (see [Data & Privacy Guidelines](#data--privacy-guidelines)).

5. **Push** your branch and open a Pull Request against `master`.

6. Fill in the PR template:
   - What does this PR change?
   - Which issue(s) does it fix? (use `Closes #<issue-number>`)
   - How was it tested?

7. A maintainer will review your PR. Please be responsive to feedback.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- `pip`

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install requests playwright openpyxl
playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

### Running scripts locally

```bash
# Generate the Excel outreach sheet
python make_sheet.py

# Add a new batch of emails
python add_pasted_batch.py

# Run the career page monitor manually
python career_watch.py
```

---

## Data & Privacy Guidelines

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository handles **real personal email addresses**. Please follow these rules strictly.

1. **Never commit credentials** - API keys, tokens, or passwords must never appear in source files or CSVs. Use environment variables or GitHub Secrets.

2. **Email validation is mandatory** - Any script that writes emails to a CSV must validate them first. Use the helper below or an equivalent:

   ```python
   import re
   EMAIL_RE = re.compile(r"^[^@\s]+@[^@\s]+\.[^@\s]+$")

   def is_valid_email(email: str) -> bool:
       return bool(EMAIL_RE.match(email.strip()))
   ```

3. **Deduplication is mandatory** - Always check for existing entries before appending. Do not let the same email appear in a file more than once.

4. **No junk/placeholder data** - Strings like `yyo`, `test`, `example@` must not appear in any CSV or email list.

5. **If in doubt, leave it out** - When unsure whether an email belongs or is valid, skip it and document why.

6. **`.gitignore` hygiene** - Do not commit local state files (e.g., `career_state.json`, `known_domains.txt`). Add them to `.gitignore`.

---

## Coding Standards

All Python contributions must follow these guidelines:

### Style
- Follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) - use `black` for auto-formatting:
  ```bash
  pip install black
  black .
  ```
- Maximum line length: **100 characters**
- Use **type hints** for function signatures where reasonable
- Use **f-strings** for string formatting (not `.format()` or `%`)

### Scripts that write CSVs

Every script that reads/writes CSV files must:
1. Use `newline=""` when opening files with the `csv` module
2. Validate all emails before writing
3. Deduplicate against existing entries
4. Print a summary on completion: rows written, rows skipped, reasons

Example template:

```python
import csv
import re

EMAIL_RE = re.compile(r"^[^@\s]+@[^@\s]+\.[^@\s]+$")
OUTPUT_FILE = "extra_contacts.csv"

EMAILS = """
# paste emails here
"""

def load_existing(filepath: str) -> set[str]:
    existing = set()
    try:
        with open(filepath, newline="") as f:
            for row in csv.reader(f):
                if row:
                    existing.add(row[0].strip().lower())
    except FileNotFoundError:
        pass
    return existing

def main():
    existing = load_existing(OUTPUT_FILE)
    written, skipped_invalid, skipped_dup = 0, 0, 0

    with open(OUTPUT_FILE, "a", newline="") as f:
        writer = csv.writer(f)
        for line in EMAILS.strip().splitlines():
            email = line.strip()
            if not email or email.startswith("#"):
                continue
            if not EMAIL_RE.match(email):
                print(f"[INVALID]   {email}")
                skipped_invalid += 1
            elif email.lower() in existing:
                print(f"[DUPLICATE] {email}")
                skipped_dup += 1
            else:
                writer.writerow([email])
                existing.add(email.lower())
                written += 1

    print(f"\nDone. Written: {written}, Invalid: {skipped_invalid}, Duplicates: {skipped_dup}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### GitHub Actions Workflows

- Every workflow step must have a **`name`** and a **`run`** command
- Always set `timeout-minutes` to prevent hung jobs from consuming Actions minutes
- Add comments explaining billing trade-offs if changing cron schedules
- Never hard-code secrets - always use `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` or custom secrets
